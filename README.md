# Project Description
This is a basic project that works provided with the back-end. This enables one to deep dive testing the skills acquired during the javascript.We first fetch (GET request) the data from the given API. The data is used and it displays the content as a list after getting the data from the API. When you click on a certain movie title...it comes down like a dropdown menu displaying the movie details.The whole code is conjoined like by use of the context as it conjoins forming a ladder. 

After the first event has been called itdispalys the list of the movie titles on the page. Plus some bit of maths is introduced cause we have to find out the number of tickets available "those that have not been purchased".

We also have the buy ticket button.This allows one to purchase a ticket and gives different outputs depending entirely on the number of available tickets.
